  Background and Purpose—The Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction In Acute
  Cerebral Haemorrhage Trial ({INTERACT}) study suggests that early intensive
  blood pressure ({BP}) lowering can attenuate hematoma growth at 24 hours
  after intracerebral hemorrhage. The present analyses aimed to determine the
  effects of treatment on hematoma and perihematomal edema over 72 hours.
  Methods—{INTERACT} included 404 patients with {CT}-confirmed intracerebral
  hemorrhage, elevated systolic {BP} (150 to 220 mm Hg), and capacity to start
  {BP}-lowering treatment within 6 hours of intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients
  were randomly assigned to an intensive (target systolic {BP} 140 {mmHg}) or
  standard guideline-based management of {BP} (target systolic {BP} 180 mm Hg)
  using routine intravenous agents. Baseline and repeat {CTs} (24 and 72 hours)
  were performed using standardized techniques with digital images analyzed
  centrally. Outcomes were increases in hematoma and perihematomal edema
  volumes over 72 hours. Results—Overall, 296 patients had all 3 {CT} scans
  available for the hematoma and 270 for the edema analyses. Mean systolic {BP}
  was 11.7 mm Hg lower in the intensive group than in the guideline group
  during 1 to 24 hours. Adjusted mean absolute increases in hematoma volumes
  ({mL}) at 24 and 72 hours were 2.40 and 0.15 in the guideline group compared
  with −0.74 and −2.31 in the intensive group, respectively, an overall
  difference of 2.80 (95\% {CI}, 1.04 to 4.56; P=0.002). Adjusted mean absolute
  increases in edema volumes ({mL}) at 24 and 72 hours were 6.27 and 10.02 in
  the guideline group compared with 4.19 and 7.34 in the intensive group,
  respectively, for an overall difference of 2.38 (95\% {CI}, −0.45 to 5.22;
  P=0.10). Conclusion—Early intensive {BP}-lowering treatment attenuated
  hematoma growth over 72 hours in intracerebral hemorrhage. There were no
  appreciable effects on perihematomal edema.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed
  characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal
  atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These
  spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases,
  such as frontotemporal dementia ({FTD}) and Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}),
  which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a
  novel symmetric image normalization method ({SyN}) for maximizing the
  cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the
  Euler–Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a
  careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human
  cortical segmentation to contrast {SyN}’s performance with a related
  elastic method and with the standard {ITK} implementation of Thirion’s
  Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in
  particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain
  is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic
  cortical labelings of {FTD} and control subjects with those gained by the
  manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested,
  {SyN}’s volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume
  measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that {SyN}, with
  cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical
  measurements in volumetric {MRI} of patients and at-risk elderly
  individuals.%

  The United States National Institutes of Health ({NIH}) commit significant
  support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment
  reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and
  evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools
  ({ANTs}), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The {ANTs} open source
  software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration,
  segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric
  analysis. In this work, we use {ANTs} to quantify, for the first time, the
  impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a
  template-based normalization study. We detail the {ANTs} implementation of
  three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster
  cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold
  cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually
  labeled, T1-weighted {MRI} brain image data of 40 subjects ({UCLA}'s {LPBA}40
  dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for
  both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results
  indicate that the best {ANTs} methods are competitive with existing brain
  extraction results (Jaccard = 0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual
  information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic
  mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard = 0.669 ± 0.022).
  Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the
  similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data
  and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this
  state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent
  transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated
  effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain
  labeling.%

  The aim of this study was to determine the 30-day mortality and morbidity of
  intracerebral hemorrhage in a large metropolitan population and to determine
  the most important predictors of 30-day outcome. We reviewed the medical
  records and computed tomographic films for all cases of spontaneous
  intracerebral hemorrhage in Greater Cincinnati during 1988. Independent
  predictors of 30-day mortality were determined using univariate and
  multivariate statistical analyses. The 30-day mortality for the 188 cases of
  intracerebral hemorrhage was 44\%, with half of deaths occurring within the
  first 2 days of onset. Volume of intracerebral hemorrhage was the strongest
  predictor of 30-day mortality for all locations of intracerebral hemorrhage.
  Using three categories of parenchymal hemorrhage volume (0 to 29 cm3, 30 to
  60 cm3, and 61 cm3 or more), calculated by a quick and easy-to-use ellipsoid
  method, and two categories of the Glasgow Coma Scale (9 or more and 8 or
  less), 30-day mortality was predicted correctly with a sensitivity of 96\%
  and a specificity of 98\%. Patients with a parenchymal hemorrhage volume of
  60 cm3 or more on their initial computed tomogram and a Glasgow Coma Scale
  score of 8 or less had a predicted 30-day mortality of 91\%. Patients with a
  volume of less than 30 cm3 and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9 or more had a
  predicted 30-day mortality of 19\%. Only one of the 71 patients with a volume
  of parenchymal hemorrhage of 30 cm3 or more could function independently at
  30 days. Volume of intracerebral hemorrhage, in combination with the initial
  Glasgow Coma Scale score, is a powerful and easy-to-use predictor of 30-day
  mortality and morbidity in patients with spontaneous intracerebral
  hemorrhage.%

  Objective: To determine potential predictors of good outcome in primary
  medium to large intracerebral haemorrhages ({ICH}) which could be useful for
  selecting patients for surgical procedures. Methods: Subjects were 138
  patients with spontaneous hemispheric {ICH} {\textgreater}20 ml. They were
  non-surgically treated and were admitted consecutively to 15 hospitals within
  the first 12 hours of symptom onset (mean ({SD}), 5.8 (3.1) hours). Haematoma
  volume was measured on computed tomography ({CT}) at admission. Stroke
  severity was assessed by the Canadian stroke scale ({CSS}). Good outcome was
  defined as modified Rankin score ⩽2 at three months. Results: At the end of
  the follow up period, 45 patients (32.6\%) had good outcome. Baseline stroke
  severity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and acute
  phase reaction biochemical markers ({ESR}, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen,
  neutrophil count) were significantly associated with good outcome in
  bivariate analyses. Of the initial {CT} scan variables, intraventricular
  contamination, deep location, mass effect, and greater {ICH} volume were
  related to poor outcome. On multiple logistic regression analysis, cortical
  location of bleeding (odds ratio 3.79 (95\% confidence interval 1.2 to
  12.01); p = 0.023), high {CSS} score ({OR} 2.3 (1.6 to 3.1);
  p{\textless}0.0001), and low fibrinogen concentrations ({OR} 0.92 (0.87 to
  0.97); p = 0.001) were independent predictors of good outcome. These three
  factors correctly classified 85\% of patients. Conclusions: Good outcome in
  medium to large {ICH} can be predicted on admission by three readily
  assessable factors ({CSS} score, {ICH} location, and fibrinogen levels).
  These predictors may be helpful in selecting patients for surgical
  treatment.%

  We develop fast algorithms for estimation of generalized linear models with
  convex penalties. The models include linear regression, two-class logistic
  regression, and multinomial regression problems while the penalties include
  ℓ1 (the lasso), ℓ2 (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two (the
  elastic net). The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along
  a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also
  deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that
  the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Computed tomographic ({CT}) images are widely used for the identification of
  abnormal brain tissue following infarct and hemorrhage in stroke. Manual
  lesion delineation is currently the standard approach, but is both
  time-consuming and operator-dependent. To address these issues, we present a
  method that can automatically delineate infarct and hemorrhage in stroke {CT}
  images. The key elements of this method are the accurate normalization of
  {CT} images from stroke patients into template space and the subsequent
  voxelwise comparison with a group of control {CT} images for defining areas
  with hypo- or hyper-intense signals. Our validation, using simulated and
  actual lesions, shows that our approach is effective in reconstructing
  lesions resulting from both infarct and hemorrhage and yields lesion maps
  spatially consistent with those produced manually by expert operators. A
  limitation is that, relative to manual delineation, there is reduced
  sensitivity of the automated method in regions close to the ventricles and
  the brain contours. However, the automated method presents a number of
  benefits in terms of offering significant time savings and the elimination of
  the inter-operator differences inherent to manual tracing approaches. These
  factors are relevant for the creation of large-scale lesion databases for
  neuropsychological research. The automated delineation of stroke lesions from
  {CT} scans may also enable longitudinal studies to quantify changes in
  damaged tissue in an objective and reproducible manner.%

  Background and Purpose—Intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) constitutes 10\% to
  15\% of all strokes and remains without a treatment of proven benefit.
  Despite several existing outcome prediction models for {ICH}, there is no
  standard clinical grading scale for {ICH} analogous to those for traumatic
  brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or ischemic stroke. Methods—Records
  of all patients with acute {ICH} presenting to the University of California,
  San Francisco during 1997–1998 were reviewed. Independent predictors of
  30-day mortality were identified by logistic regression. A risk
  stratification scale (the {ICH} Score) was developed with weighting of
  independent predictors based on strength of association. Results—Factors
  independently associated with 30-day mortality were Glasgow Coma Scale score
  (P{\textless}0.001), age ≥80 years (P=0.001), infratentorial origin of
  {ICH} (P=0.03), {ICH} volume (P=0.047), and presence of intraventricular
  hemorrhage (P=0.052). The {ICH} Score was the sum of individual points
  assigned as follows: {GCS} score 3 to 4 (=2 points), 5 to 12 (=1), 13 to 15
  (=0); age ≥80 years yes (=1), no (=0); infratentorial origin yes (=1), no
  (=0); {ICH} volume ≥30 cm3 (=1), {\textless}30 cm3 (=0); and
  intraventricular hemorrhage yes (=1), no (=0). All 26 patients with an {ICH}
  Score of 0 survived, and all 6 patients with an {ICH} Score of 5 died.
  Thirty-day mortality increased steadily with {ICH} Score (P{\textless}0.005).
  Conclusions—The {ICH} Score is a simple clinical grading scale that allows
  risk stratification on presentation with {ICH}. The use of a scale such as
  the {ICH} Score could improve standardization of clinical treatment protocols
  and clinical research studies in {ICH}.%

  Background and Purpose—The reliability of hematoma volume ({HV})
  measurement using the {ABC}/2 method in multicenter clinical trials is
  unknown. We determined the accuracy of {ABC}/2 method as an on-site test in
  comparison with the gold standard central {HV}-assessment and semiautomatic
  {HV}-assessment. Method—We analyzed data from an acute intracerebral
  hemorrhage multicenter clinical trial. {HV} was measured by site
  investigators to determine enrollment eligibility ({\textless}60 cm3) using
  the {ABC}/2 method (on-site {HV}), and independently by the core-imaging
  laboratory using computer-based analysis (Medical Image Processing, Analysis,
  and Visualization [{MIPAV}] {HV}). {HV} was also measured by {ABC}/2 method
  (central {HV}) at the core-imaging laboratory to assess the difference in
  measurements between on-site (multiple raters with variable experiences) and
  central (single experienced rater) {HVs}. Results—Fifty-six subjects were
  analyzed (mean age 62±15 years; 45\% women). On-site {HV} values showed a
  significantly lower correlation with the {MIPAV} {HV} (r=0.63) than central
  {HV} and {MIPAV} {HV} (r=0.93) values. The correlation between on-site {HV}
  and central {HV} values was modest (r=0.51). A total of 73\% of the central
  {HVs} were within 25\% of the corresponding {MIPAV} {HVs}, whereas only 46\%
  of the on-site {HVs} were within 25\% of the corresponding {MIPAV} {HVs}
  (P{\textless}0.001). One protocol violation occurred as a result of
  inaccuracy of on-site {HV} measurement. Conclusion—On-site {HV}
  measurements showed high variability, but the impact on the eligibility
  determination was small. Centralized remeasurements of {HVs} with feedback to
  the sites may increase the reliability of the on-site {HV} measurements.

  Background and Purpose Hemorrhage volume is a powerful predictor of 30-day
  mortality after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}). We compared a
  bedside method of measuring {CT} {ICH} volume with measurements made by
  computer-assisted planimetric image analysis. Methods The formula {ABC}/2 was
  used, where A is the greatest hemorrhage diameter by {CT}, B is the diameter
  90° to A, and C is the approximate number of {CT} slices with hemorrhage
  multiplied by the slice thickness. Results The {ICH} volumes for 118 patients
  were evaluated in a mean of 38 seconds and correlated with planimetric
  measurements (R2=.96). Interrater and intrarater reliability were excellent,
  with an intraclass correlation of .99 for both. Conclusions We conclude that
  {ICH} volume can be accurately estimated in less than 1 minute with the
  simple formula {ABC}/2.%

  Background and Purpose—Perihematomal edema ({PHE}) can worsen outcomes
  after intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}). Reports suggest that blood
  degradation products lead to {PHE}. We hypothesized that hematoma evacuation
  will reduce {PHE} volume and that treatment with recombinant tissue-type
  plasminogen activator (rt-{PA}) will not exacerbate it. Methods—Minimally
  invasive surgery and rt-{PA} in {ICH} evacuation ({MISTIE}) phase {II} tested
  safety and efficacy of hematoma evacuation after {ICH}. We conducted a
  semiautomated, computerized volumetric analysis on computed tomography to
  assess impact of hematoma removal on {PHE} and effects of rt-{PA} on {PHE}.
  Volumetric analyses were performed on baseline stability and end of treatment
  scans. Results—Seventy-nine surgical and 39 medical patients from minimally
  invasive surgery and rt-{PA} in {ICH} evacuation phase {II} ({MISTIE} {II})
  were analyzed. Mean hematoma volume at end of treatment was 19.6±14.5 cm3
  for the surgical cohort and 40.7±13.9 cm3 for the medical cohort
  (P{\textless}0.001). Edema volume at end of treatment was lower for the
  surgical cohort: 27.7±13.3 cm3 than medical cohort: 41.7±14.6 cm3
  (P{\textless}0.001). Graded effect of clot removal on {PHE} was observed when
  patients with {\textgreater}65\%, 20\% to 65\%, and {\textless}20\% {ICH}
  removed were analyzed (P{\textless}0.001). Positive correlation between {PHE}
  reduction and percent of {ICH} removed was identified (ρ=0.658;
  P{\textless}0.001). In the surgical cohort, 69 patients underwent surgical
  aspiration and rt-{PA}, whereas 10 underwent surgical aspiration only. Both
  cohorts achieved similar clot reduction: surgical aspiration and rt-{PA},
  18.9±14.5 cm3; and surgical aspiration only, 24.5±14.0 cm3 (P=0.26). Edema
  at end of treatment in surgical aspiration and rt-{PA} was 28.1±13.8 cm3 and
  24.4±8.6 cm3 in surgical aspiration only (P=0.41). Conclusions—Hematoma
  evacuation is associated with significant reduction in {PHE}. Furthermore,
  {PHE} does not seem to be exacerbated by rt-{PA}, making such neurotoxic

  {AbstractBackground} X-ray computed tomography ({CT}) imaging of the brain is
  commonly used in diagnostic settings. Although {CT} scans are primarily used
  in clinical practice, they are increasingly used in research. A fundamental
  processing step in brain imaging research is brain extraction — the process
  of separating the brain tissue from all other tissues. Methods for brain
  extraction have either been 1) validated but not fully automated, or 2) fully
  automated and informally proposed, but never formally validated. Aim To
  systematically analyze and validate the performance of {FSL}'s brain
  extraction tool ({BET}) on head {CT} images of patients with intracranial
  hemorrhage. This was done by comparing the manual gold standard with the
  results of several versions of automatic brain extraction and by estimating
  the reliability of automated segmentation of longitudinal scans. The effects
  of the choice of {BET} parameters and data smoothing is studied and reported.
  Methods All images were thresholded using a 0–100 Hounsfield unit ({HU})
  range. In one variant of the pipeline, data were smoothed using a
  3-dimensional Gaussian kernel (σ = 1 mm3) and re-thresholded to 0–100
  {HU}; in the other, data were not smoothed. {BET} was applied using 1 of 3
  fractional intensity ({FI}) thresholds: 0.01, 0.1, or 0.35 and any holes in
  the brain mask were filled. For validation against a manual segmentation, 36
  images from patients with intracranial hemorrhage were selected from 19
  different centers from the {MISTIE} (Minimally Invasive Surgery plus
  recombinant-tissue plasminogen activator for Intracerebral Evacuation) stroke
  trial. Intracranial masks of the brain were manually created by one expert
  {CT} reader. The resulting brain tissue masks were quantitatively compared to
  the manual segmentations using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the
  Dice Similarity Index ({DSI}). Brain extraction performance across smoothing
  and {FI} thresholds was compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The
  intracranial volume ({ICV}) of each scan was estimated by multiplying the
  number of voxels in the brain mask by the dimensions of each voxel for that
  scan. From this, we calculated the {ICV} ratio comparing manual and automated
  segmentation: I C V automated I C V manual . To estimate the performance in a
  large number of scans, brain masks were generated from the 6 {BET} pipelines
  for 1095 longitudinal scans from 129 patients. Failure rates were estimated
  from visual inspection. {ICV} of each scan was estimated and an intraclass
  correlation ({ICC}) was estimated using a one-way {ANOVA}. Results Smoothing
  images improves brain extraction results using {BET} for all measures except
  specificity (all p \&lt; 0.01, uncorrected), irrespective of the {FI}
  threshold. Using an {FI} of 0.01 or 0.1 performed better than 0.35. Thus, all
  reported results refer only to smoothed data using an {FI} of 0.01 or 0.1.
  Using an {FI} of 0.01 had a higher median sensitivity (0.9901) than an {FI}
  of 0.1 (0.9884, median difference: 0.0014, p \&lt; 0.001), accuracy (0.9971
  vs. 0.9971; median difference: 0.0001, p \&lt; 0.001), and {DSI} (0.9895 vs.
  0.9894; median difference: 0.0004, p \&lt; 0.001) and lower specificity
  (0.9981 vs. 0.9982; median difference: − 0.0001, p \&lt; 0.001). These
  measures are all very high indicating that a range of {FI} values may produce
  visually indistinguishable brain extractions. Using smoothed data and an {FI}
  of 0.01, the mean ({SD}) {ICV} ratio was 1.002 (0.008); the mean being close
  to 1 indicates the {ICV} estimates are similar for automated and manual
  segmentation. In the 1095 longitudinal scans, this pipeline had a low failure
  rate (5.2\%) and the {ICC} estimate was high (0.929, 95\% {CI}: 0.91, 0.945)
  for successfully extracted brains. Conclusion {BET} performs well at brain
  extraction on thresholded, 1 mm3 smoothed {CT} images with an {FI} of 0.01 or
  0.1. Smoothing before applying {BET} is an important step not previously
  discussed in the literature. Analysis code is provided.%

  {ABSTRACT} {BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE} Infarct volume is used as a surrogate
  outcome measure in clinical trials of therapies for acute ischemic stroke.
  {ABC}/2 is a fast volumetric method, but its accuracy remains to be
  determined. We aimed to study the accuracy and reproducibility of {ABC}/2 in
  determining acute infarct volume with diffusion-weighted imaging. {METHODS}
  We studied 86 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke. Three blinded
  observers determined volume with the {ABC}/2 method, and the results were
  compared with those of the manual planimetric method. {RESULTS} The {ABC}/2
  technique overestimated infarct volume by a median false increase (variable
  {ABC}/2 volume minus planimetric volume) of 7.33 cm3 (1.29, 22.170,
  representing a 162.56\% increase over the value of the gold standard
  (variable {ABC}/2 volume over planimetric volume) (121.70, 248.52). In each
  method, the interrater reliability was excellent: the intraclass correlations
  were .992 and .985 for the {ABC}/2 technique and planimetric method,
  respectively. {CONCLUSIONS} {ABC}/2 is volumetric method with clinical value
  but it consistently overestimates the real infarct volume. J Neuroimaging

  Purpose An automatic, accurate and fast segmentation of hemorrhage in brain
  Computed Tomography ({CT}) images is necessary for quantification and
  treatment planning when assessing a large number of data sets. Though manual
  segmentation is accurate, it is time consuming and tedious. Semi-automatic
  methods need user interactions and might introduce variability in results.
  Our study proposes a modified distance regularized level set evolution
  ({MDRLSE}) algorithm for hemorrhage segmentation. Methods Study data set
  (from the ongoing {CLEAR}-{IVH} phase {III} clinical trial) is comprised of
  200 sequential {CT} scans of 40 patients collected at 10 different hospitals
  using different machines/vendors. Data set contained both constant and
  variable slice thickness scans. Our study included pre-processing (filtering
  and skull removal), segmentation ({MDRLSE} which is a two-stage method with
  shrinking and expansion) with modified parameters for faster convergence and
  higher accuracy and post-processing (reduction in false positives and false
  negatives). Results Results are validated against the gold standard marked
  manually by a trained {CT} reader and neurologist. Data sets are grouped as
  small, medium and large based on the volume of blood. Statistical analysis is
  performed for both training and test data sets in each group. The median Dice
  statistical indices ({DSI}) for the 3 groups are 0.8971, 0.8580 and 0.9173
  respectively. Pre- and post-processing enhanced the {DSI} by 8 and 4\%
  respectively. Conclusions The {MDRLSE} improved the accuracy and speed for
  segmentation and calculation of the hemorrhage volume compared to the
  original {DRLSE} method. The method generates quantitative information, which
  is useful for specific decision making and reduces the time needed for the
  clinicians to localize and segment the hemorrhagic regions.%

  Background There is some evidence that hyperglycemia increases the rate of
  poor outcomes in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}). We explored
  the relationship between various parameters of serum glucose concentrations
  measured during acute hospitalization and hematoma expansion, perihematomal
  edema, and three month outcome among subjects with {ICH}. Methods A post-hoc
  analysis of a multicenter prospective study recruiting subjects with {ICH}
  and elevated systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) ≥170 {mmHg} who presented
  within 6 h of symptom onset was performed. The serum glucose concentration
  was measured repeatedly up to 5 times over 3 days after admission and change
  over time was characterized using a summary statistic by fitting the linear
  regression model for each subject. The admission glucose, glucose change
  between admission and 24 hour glucose concentration, and estimated parameters
  (slope and intercept) were entered in the logistic regression model
  separately to predict the functional outcome as measured by modified Rankin
  scale ({mRS}) at 90 days (0–3 vs. 4–6); hematoma expansion at 24 h (≤33
  vs. {\textgreater}33\%); and relative perihematomal edema expansion at 24 h
  (≤40 vs. {\textgreater}40\%). Results A total of 60 subjects were recruited
  (aged 62.0 ±15.1 years; 56.7\% men). The mean of initial glucose
  concentration (±standard deviation) was 136.7 mg/dl (±58.1). Thirty-five
  out of 60 (58\%) subjects had a declining glucose over time (negative slope).
  The risk of poor outcome ({mRS} 4–6) in those with increasing serum glucose
  levels was over two-fold relative to those who had declining serum glucose
  levels ({RR} = 2.64, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 1.03, 6.75). The {RRs}
  were 2.59 (95\% {CI}: 1.27, 5.30) for hematoma expansion {\textgreater}33\%;
  and 1.25 (95\% {CI}: 0.73, 2.13) for relative edema expansion
  {\textgreater}40\%. Conclusions Decline in serum glucose concentration
  correlated with reduction in proportion of subjects with hematoma expansion
  and poor clinical outcome. These results provide a justification for a
  randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of aggressive
  serum glucose reduction in reducing death and disability among patients with

  Traditionally lesion location has been reported using standard templates,
  text based descriptions or representative raw slices from the patient's {CT}
  or {MRI} scan. Each of these methods has drawbacks for the display of
  neuroanatomical data. One solution is to display {MRI} scans in the same
  stereotaxic space popular with researchers working in functional
  neuroimaging. Presenting brains in this format is useful as the slices
  correspond to the standard anatomical atlases used by neuroimagers. In
  addition, lesion position and volume are directly comparable across patients.
  This article describes freely available software for presenting
  stereotaxically aligned patient scans. This article focuses on {MRI} scans,
  but many of these tools are also applicable to other modalities (e.g. {CT},
  {PET} and {SPECT}). We suggest that this technique of presenting lesions in
  terms of images normalized to standard stereotaxic space should become the
  standard for neuropsychological studies.%

  Spatial normalization reshapes an individual's brain to match the shape and
  size of a template image. This is a crucial step required for group-level
  statistical analyses. The most popular standard templates are derived from
  {MRI} scans of young adults. We introduce specialized templates that allow
  normalization algorithms to be applied to stroke-aged populations. First, we
  developed a {CT} template: while this is the dominant modality for many
  clinical situations, there are no modern {CT} templates and popular
  algorithms fail to successfully normalize {CT} scans. Importantly, our
  template was based on healthy individuals with ages similar to what is
  commonly seen in stroke (mean 65 years old). This template allows studies
  where only {CT} scans are available. Second, we derived a {MRI} template that
  approximately matches the shape of our {CT} template as well as processing
  steps that aid the normalization of scans from older individuals (including
  lesion masking and the ability to generate high quality cortical renderings
  despite brain injury). The benefit of this strategy is that the resulting
  templates can be used in studies where mixed modalities are present. We have
  integrated these templates and processing algorithms into a simple {SPM}
  toolbox (http://www.mricro.com/clinical-toolbox/spm8-scripts).%

  Background and Purpose— Intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) is the most fatal
  and disabling stroke subtype. Widely used tools for prediction of mortality
  are fundamentally limited in that they do not account for effects of
  withdrawal of care and are not designed to predict functional recovery. We
  developed an acute clinical score to predict likelihood of functional
  independence. Methods— We prospectively characterized 629 consecutive
  patients with {ICH} at hospital presentation. Predictors of functional
  independence (Glasgow Outcome Score ≥4) at 90 days were used to develop a
  logistic regression-based risk stratification scale in a random subset of two
  thirds and validated in the remaining one third of the cohort. Results— At
  90 days, 162 (26\%) patients achieved independence. Age, Glasgow Coma Scale,
  {ICH} location, volume (all P{\textless}0.0001), and pre-{ICH} cognitive
  impairment (P=0.005) were independently associated with Glasgow Outcome Score
  ≥4. The {FUNC} score was developed as a sum of individual points (0–11)
  based on strength of association with outcome. In both the development and
  validation cohorts, the proportion of patients who achieved Glasgow Outcome
  Score ≥4 increased steadily with {FUNC} score. No patient assigned a {FUNC}
  score ≤4 achieved functional independence, whereas {\textgreater}80\% with
  a score of 11 did. The predictive accuracy of the {FUNC} score remained
  unchanged when restricted to {ICH} survivors only, consistent with absence of
  confounding by early withdrawal of care. Conclusions— {FUNC} score is a
  valid clinical assessment tool that identifies patients with {ICH} who will
  attain functional independence and thus, can provide guidance in clinical
  decision-making and patient selection for clinical trials.%

  An automated method for segmenting magnetic resonance head images into brain
  and non-brain has been developed. It is very robust and accurate and has been
  tested on thousands of data sets from a wide variety of scanners and taken
  with a wide variety of {MR} sequences. The method, Brain Extraction Tool
  ({BET}), uses a deformable model that evolves to fit the brain's surface by
  the application of a set of locally adaptive model forces. The method is very
  fast and requires no preregistration or other pre-processing before being
  applied. We describe the new method and give examples of results and the
  results of extensive quantitative testing against “gold-standard” hand
  segmentations, and two other popular automated methods. Hum. Brain Mapping

  We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso'
  minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute
  value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature
  of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0
  and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the
  lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and
  ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and
  exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting
  relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and
  Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of
  statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and
  tree-based models are briefly described.%

  Background and Purpose—The {ABC}/2 score estimates intracerebral hemorrhage
  ({ICH}) volume, yet validations have been limited by small samples and
  inappropriate outcome measures. We determined accuracy of the {ABC}/2 score
  calculated at a specialized reading center ({RC}-{ABC}) or local site
  (site-{ABC}) versus the reference-standard computed tomography–based
  planimetry ({CTP}). Methods—In Minimally Invasive Surgery Plus Recombinant
  Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator for Intracerebral Hemorrhage
  Evacuation-{II} ({MISTIE}-{II}), Clot Lysis Evaluation of Accelerated
  Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage ({CLEAR}-{IVH}) and {CLEAR}-{III}
  trials. {ICH} volume was prospectively calculated by {CTP}, {RC}-{ABC}, and
  site-{ABC}. Agreement between {CTP} and {ABC}/2 was defined as an absolute
  difference up to 5 {mL} and relative difference within 20\%. Determinants of
  {ABC}/2 accuracy were assessed by logistic regression. Results—In 4369
  scans from 507 patients, {CTP} was more strongly correlated with {RC}-{ABC}
  (r2=0.93) than with site-{ABC} (r2=0.87). Although {RC}-{ABC} overestimated
  {CTP}-based volume on average ({RC}-{ABC}, 15.2 cm3; {CTP}, 12.7 cm3),
  agreement was reasonable when categorized into mild, moderate, and severe
  {ICH} (κ=0.75; P{\textless}0.001). This was consistent with overestimation
  of {ICH} volume in 6 of 8 previous studies. Agreement with {CTP} was greater
  for {RC}-{ABC} (84\% within 5 {mL}; 48\% of scans within 20\%) than for
  site-{ABC} (81\% within 5 {mL}; 41\% within 20\%). {RC}-{ABC} had moderate
  accuracy for detecting ≥5 {mL} change in {CTP} volume between consecutive
  scans (sensitivity, 0.76; specificity, 0.86) and was more accurate with
  smaller {ICH}, thalamic hemorrhage, and homogeneous clots.
  Conclusions—{ABC}/2 scores at local or central sites are sufficiently
  accurate to categorize {ICH} volume and assess eligibility for the
  {CLEAR}-{III} and {MISTIE} {III} studies and moderately accurate for change
  in {ICH} volume. However, accuracy decreases with large, irregular, or lobar
  clots. Clinical Trial Registration—{URL}: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.
  Unique identifier: {MISTIE}-{II} {NCT}00224770; {CLEAR}-{III} {NCT}00784134.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  We consider an application in electricity grid load prediction, where
  generalized additive models are appropriate, but where the data set's size
  can make their use practically intractable with existing methods. We
  therefore develop practical generalized additive model fitting methods for
  large data sets in the case in which the smooth terms in the model are
  represented by using penalized regression splines. The methods use iterative
  update schemes to obtain factors of the model matrix while requiring only
  subblocks of the model matrix to be computed at any one time. We show that
  efficient smoothing parameter estimation can be carried out in a
  well-justified manner. The grid load prediction problem requires updates of
  the model fit, as new data become available, and some means for dealing with
  residual auto-correlation in grid load. Methods are provided for these
  problems and parallel implementation is covered. The methods allow estimation
  of generalized additive models for large data sets by using modest computer
  hardware, and the grid load prediction problem illustrates the utility of
  reduced rank spline smoothing methods for dealing with complex modelling
  problems.%
